        "Co-folding -- originally developed as part of the DragonFold project at Charm Therapeutics -- builds on the protein structure prediction concepts pioneered by the team at DeepMind working on AlphaFold.\n",
        "\n",
        "While early methods like AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold could “only” predict protein structures, these newer approaches can not only determine protein structures *but also* generate the structures of bound ligands.\n",
        "\n",
        "Co-folding methods use a training set of structures from the PDB to learn the relationship between a protein structure and a corresponding bound ligand. The model learned from the training set is then used to generate the structures of new complexes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The field is very excited about these methods as target-ligand co-folding methods may be able to surpass classical methods like docking and even replace physics-based free energy perturbation approaches, which demand computationally expensive molecular dynamics simulations and force field optimizations.\n"
